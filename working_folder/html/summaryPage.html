   <p>  The purpose of this project was to build an HTML based dashboard.  
     The project used data from the OpenWeatherMap API to a assemble a 
     dataset for 500 cities.  The data is used to prove the relationships between 
     weather and its distantance to the equator. 
    </p>     

    <p>
     The data was munged using Python Pandas library.  The graphs were generated with 
     the Matplotlib library. This site compares the weather properties against given
     cities' latitudes on the globe.  The site compares temperature, wind speed, cloadiness 
     and humidity. Trends are captured in the four visualizations.
